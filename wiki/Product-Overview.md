- Offer timely guidance (e.g., pain management advice and anomaly alerts).
- Preserve user privacy by keeping data local with optional export/import.
- Support optional Google Calendar sync so users can view cycle events alongside their schedule.
- Deliver a reliable, offline-capable mobile experience via PWA.

## Target Users
- People who menstruate and want a privacy-first tracker.
- Users seeking symptom correlation and cycle awareness.
